# new amkoconsulting website

I'm making the new site for my limited company, [AMKO Consulting Ltd](http://amkoconsulting.co.uk).

It's designed for 1920px width, but will be responsive to fill the screen on a number of different resolutions

Tech Bit
--------

I'm writing it on a quick-and-dirty Ruby/Sinatra/CoffeeScript/SCSS stack, based on my [Sinatra HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/iamkoch/sinatra-html5-boilerplate)
